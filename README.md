Lightberry Config Download
==========================

Simple plugin to easily download hyperion/boblight config files. 

What it has to offer:
   * Downloads hyperion/boblight configs for different led placements (horizontal x vertical)
   * Differentiate between OpenELEC (different config and effects placement) and other systems
   * Replace grabber section (causes hyperion to fail if there is no /dev/video device)

Please create issues, functionality requests here - I can use any sugestion, I'm not python begginer. Thank you in advance.
